# Shape Keys Widget was started as an alternative to "Shape Key Selector V1.0"
# by Vertex Arcade after it turned into more than a little bit of adapting and
# fixing the existing add-on. This project no longer has any code/content/docs
# from "Shape Key Selector V1.0". It also departed from the original rigging and
# animating workflow, but keeps the idea of visual thumbnails in the 3D View.
